WebViz uses RosBridge for communication. 
To launch rosbridge: roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
Port can be defined using port paramater, i.e. 

<launch>
  <include file="$(find rosbridge_server)/launch/rosbridge_websocket.launch" > 
     <arg name="port" value="8080"/>
  </include>
</launch>


Alternately, running rosboard will allow you to visualize by running rosboard.launch and going to 
http://your-robot-ip:8888/
on any device (works on mobile!)
